        <div class="HEADER">About Meditation</div>
        <div class="content">Meditation is to understand that the essence of our life is just like a movie. The movie seems to be coherent, but in fact it is frame by frame. High-level meditation can see this essence, and it can pass through the gap between frames. This is "entering concentration", and there are various pleasant experiences in it. In addition, we can also see that the experience of frame after frame is fleeting, and there is no continuous connection that constitutes the "I" (insight). As a result, "I" can look at "I"'s life and world with a new understanding, which can enable us to live more freely and open-mindedly.

            Meditation originated in the East, but it flourishes in the West in modern times. In the 1970s, Dr. Kabakin, a physician from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, combined meditation and psychology, applied meditation to his critically ill patients, and discovered that meditation could help everyone relieve pain and release stress. He then developed a stress reduction course suitable for business people. With the development of brainwave science, originally illusory emotions and brain activity can be quantified by tracking records. The effect of meditation is no longer a myth, but a scientifically visible and measurable parameter. At present, meditation training has become the most popular training course in Silicon Valley. Google, Facebook, Linkedin, Salesforce all use meditation courses to help companies and employees get better efficiency, creativity, and work happiness index. In addition to being sought after by technology companies on the west coast of the United States, meditation is also popular in the financial world on the east coast of the United States. Dario, the founder of the world hedge fund giant Bridgewater Fund, publicly declared that meditation is one of the most critical factors for him to get rich.</div>
