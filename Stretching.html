        <div class="HEADER">About Stretching</div>
        <div class="content">

           <div class="fontb" ><b>Improve control over the body</b></div></br>
[Doing too much stretching will lose muscle strength and joints will become unstable. ] This statement is a dangerous myth. This is not true at all. Increasing the length of the muscle can increase the strength of the muscle to contract freely. In other words, stretching exercises such as stretching can increase muscle strength, and exercise capacity will therefore become stronger, while also making the body's dynamic balance better or improving the ability to control muscles.
        </br></br><div class="fontb"><b>Reduce muscle soreness after exercise</b></div></br>
We all have this kind of experience; after several months of no exercise, after going jogging, climbing or going to the gym for the first time, the muscles feel unusually tight, sore, and stiff the next day, and often have difficulty even going down the stairs. This kind of muscle soreness is usually called [post-exercise muscle soreness]. This soreness is the result of micro-ruptures (broken micro-tissues in muscle fibers), formation of blood pools, and accumulation of waste products such as lactic acid. Stretching It can be used as an effective relaxation exercise to alleviate this soreness by stretching muscle fibers, promoting blood circulation and expelling waste.</br></br><div class="fontb"><b>Reduce fatigue</b></div></br>
Fatigue is a big problem for everyone, especially people with exercise habits have to face this problem. Fatigue reduces our physical and mental performance. Continuous stretching can increase flexibility, thereby reducing the pressure on the muscles (active muscles) responsible for operation and achieving the effect of preventing fatigue. Every muscle of the human body has an opposite or opposite muscle (antagonist muscle). If the opposite muscle is softer, the muscle responsible for functioning (active muscle) does not need to spend too much effort against the antagonist muscle, and of course it does not require so much effort.
